In this course project, we delved into the dynamics of live e-commerce data by selecting two live streaming rooms as subjects for data analysis. Through real-time analysis and deep prediction, we forecasted key metrics such as transaction volumes, audience numbers, and interaction behaviors within the live streams. Our research ensured data accuracy and extracted essential interaction metrics by performing comprehensive preprocessing of live stream data and utilizing natural language processing techniques to analyze comment texts. Subsequently, we designed and implemented a time series-based prediction model that integrated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Random Forest algorithms, accurately predicting the key business indicators of the live streams. The model training results demonstrated our ability to effectively predict the dynamic changes in live e-commerce, providing live stream merchants with a real-time monitoring and decision-support tool.
