Our startup, "Old" Friends, is a comprehensive internet-based elderly care service platform designed to provide all-encompassing services that meet the medical care, daily consumption, leisure and entertainment, and life assurance needs of the elderly population. We plan to collaborate with medical institutions and service providers to integrate online and offline resources, utilizing advanced technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to optimize service processes and user experience. To rapidly expand our market share, we adopt a strategy that combines offline activities with online marketing, deepening partnerships with communities, hospitals, and other institutions to build a community of elderly care services that involves the entire population. Additionally, we have established a strict financial management system to ensure financial stability and project sustainability through venture capital and government funding. Our goal is to establish a competitive advantage in the market in the short term and, in the long term, to expand our services nationwide and even internationally, forming a globally comprehensive elderly care service network. By providing high-quality services and innovative solutions, "Old" Friends will continuously drive the development of the elderly care service industry and improve the quality of life for the elderly.
