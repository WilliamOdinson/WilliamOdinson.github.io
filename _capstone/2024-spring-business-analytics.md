In this project, we provided scientific and precise housing recommendations for graduate students preparing for entrance exams. Through extensive surveys and housing data from Tianjin City, we conducted an in-depth analysis of graduate students' housing needs using the Entropy Weight Method and the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method. The Entropy Weight Method helped us determine the weights of various factors in evaluating housing options, while the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method allowed us to effectively match graduate students' needs with the characteristics of available housing in the market. Through this comprehensive approach, we successfully developed a recommendation system that accurately reflects graduate students' housing preferences, providing housing providers with targeted market insights and helping them serve this specific customer group more effectively.
