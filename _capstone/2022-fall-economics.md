In our final research report for the Economics course, we thoroughly explored Pinduoduo's business model and its successful trajectory in the e-commerce sector. Through systematic literature review and case analysis, we detailed how Pinduoduo leverages social marketing and the C2M (Consumer-to-Manufacturer) model to create a unique market positioning. Additionally, we examined how Pinduoduo utilizes social networks and strategies targeting lower-tier markets to successfully attract and retain a large user base. Methodologically, we employed various economic theories, including demand and supply theory, price elasticity theory, and the spider web model, to analyze Pinduoduo's market behavior and consumer responses. This helped us understand the operational mechanisms of the modern e-commerce market and its impact on traditional retail industries.
