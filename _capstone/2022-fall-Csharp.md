"ForestMan: A Replicate of Forest Ice and Fire Man" is a classic action-adventure game that I recreated using the C# programming language, based on Windows Forms technology. It combines innovative gameplay with rich interactive experiences. The core features of the game include a dynamic character control system that allows players to perform smooth running and jumping actions; a responsive gravity and dynamic obstacle handling mechanism that ensures the authenticity and challenge of the gameplay. Additionally, I designed elevator control mechanisms and various animation effects, such as visual effects for ice and fire pools and poison pools, as well as character death and level completion animations, significantly enhancing the game's immersion and visual appeal. A technical challenge was preventing clipping; to address this, I implemented precise speed control and position update strategies, and achieved smooth movement control through keyboard event handling.
