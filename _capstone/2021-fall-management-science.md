In our management course research, we delved deeply into Huawei's digital transformation. We focused on reading literature related to Huawei's internationalization of R&D and technological management innovations. Using case analysis and literature review methods, we systematically organized and analyzed the drivers behind Huawei's international R&D efforts and its strategic adjustments. We applied the PEST model to thoroughly examine the background of the digital transformation and utilized SWOT analysis to explore Huawei's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats during this process. Our research not only concentrated on the technical and strategic aspects but also encompassed multiple dimensions such as organizational management, cultural transformation, and market demand, providing a comprehensive perspective to understand Huawei's transformation journey. Through this study, we gained a deeper understanding of how management theories and practices interact and how to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing global market.
