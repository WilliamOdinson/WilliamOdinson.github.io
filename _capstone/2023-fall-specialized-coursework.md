We designed "MyLife", a one-stop learning, social, and entertainment platform tailored for student groups. The goal was to provide a comprehensive solution that allows users to engage in learning, socializing, and entertainment activities all on one platform. "MyLife" was developed using Python and the Django framework, with the front end utilizing HTML5, Bootstrap, and jQuery technologies, and enhanced with JavaScript to ensure a user-friendly interface. The platform integrates graph neural networks, BERT, PCA, LSTM, and other technologies to support precise movie and music recommendations. For database technology, MySQL was used as the primary data storage solution. In terms of cloud deployment, we employed Nginx as a reverse proxy server, combined with uWSGI as the application server for deployment.
