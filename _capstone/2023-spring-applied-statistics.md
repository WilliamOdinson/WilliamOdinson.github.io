In this project, we focused on collecting and analyzing data from China's new energy vehicle industry with the aim of forecasting future sales and exploring the key factors influencing these sales. We applied the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to make relatively accurate predictions of the industry's development trends. Additionally, we established a multiple linear regression model to analyze how various potential factors affect sales. When examining the factors influencing new energy vehicle sales, the ordinary multiple linear regression model faced issues such as multicollinearity, highlighting its limitations. By comparing Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we found that PCA effectively optimized this problem without requiring extensive preprocessing of the original data. Our analysis demonstrated that major unexpected public events like the COVID-19 pandemic and their subsequent ongoing impacts could interfere with the accuracy of time series predictions to some extent. However, results from test samples indicated that this influence was not severe.
